# Tools versions

Make sure to install and use required tools:

- NodeJS @ 20.16.0
- NPM @ 10.8.1

# Environment

## Cloning this project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samuelpietra/pokedex.git
```

## Installing dependencies

This project contains both `ui` and `server` projects. You may want to use two terminal instances in order to test our fullstack experience.

### Backend dependencies

```bash
cd server && npm install
```

### Frontend dependencies

```bash
cd ui && npm install
```

## Creating .env file

By now, only our frontend project will need an environment file to avoid breaking on build due to linting warnings.

```bash
cd ui && cp .env.example .env.local
```

# Getting started

Now you should be able to start running both `ui` and `server` projects.

## Starting backend server

```bash
cd server && npm run dev
```

## Starting frontend server

```bash
cd ui && npm start
```

# Responsiveness

In order to build and scale things faster, most of this project was built with [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) - a clever abstraction of [radix-ui primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives) styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

By this way, we could easily apply breaking points for many different screen resolutions. We tried to focus on the same breakpoints that Tailwind advices at their [Responsive Design](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design) documentation.

# Current status
